scrollProgress
==============

This scripts show a progress bar that indicates how much you've scrolled on a website. It's very useful to show the reading progress in an article or a blog post. Just add the script and call _scrollProgress.init()_, a black bar on the upper part of your website to show the scrolling progress.
